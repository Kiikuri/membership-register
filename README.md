This was my 2nd development project ever, and an introduction to Java and JavaFX. 

I personally can't get the code to run for whatever reason because something broke throughout the years.

Fixing the code would require more effort than I have interest in repairing the program, as this was just a school project in an already completed course.

I have however included screenshots from the UI, which were taken during the development process.
